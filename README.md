    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    How do I approach designing software?


1) The key to ensuring that your code, program, and software is function and secure is to obtain the testing mindset, and test early and often -- even before writing a single line of code. 

2) The perfect way is to obtain user stories. Talk with the end users and see what their pain points are. Implement these changes. Test the new implementations, and you should have a happy customer. 

3) Use static testing techniques even before writing a single line of code. Understanding the project and it's requirements goes a long way in the quality of your product.
